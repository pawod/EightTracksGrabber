HOW TO USE
————————————————————————
1. Start the EightTracksGrabber.exe
   WINOWS: simply double click the file
   OS X: open a new terminal window and type “mono <path to containing directory>/EightTracksGrabber.exe”

2. A list of available network devices will appear. Choose the network device you are currently using to connect with the internet, by entering the number of the device ID. In most cases you will use either the WiFi or Ethernet adapter. On MAC OS X it is mostly called “en0”.
2. Any time you want to use the grabber make sure you are not visiting through HTTPS: Just remove the “https://“ prefix in front of the URL and you will be listening through HTTP. Else the grabber won’t be able to track the traffic between you and the server. 
3. Pick a playlist on 8Tracks.com and play it. The grabber will download it, while you listen to it. You can find the downloaded tracks by default in the 8Tracks folder on your desktop. Remember, that the tool must be started, before you open a playlist the first time so it can read the current playlist’s name and the user who created it.
4. Report your errors and logfiles to me so I can further improve this tool. The logfile will be placed inside the log folder once you start the tool (right next to the .exe). If you are missing some feature let me know, I will add it to my TODO list.
